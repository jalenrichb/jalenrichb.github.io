		<h3>Rhea of Sunshine 2</h3>
		<p id="description">Rhea of Sunshine, a Valentine's Day game created 
			using C#, follows me, Jalen, and the pursuit of Rhea's love. 
			I thoroughly enjoyed making this game as it exposed me to new 
			technologies. Picking it up was quite simple as C#, and 
			C++(my primary language) are based on C.</p>

		<h3>GPA Calculator</h3>
		<p>GPA Calculator uses C++ to calculate a Grade Point Average once 
			entering classes and their credits. Once all information has 
			been inputted, it will output a simple report card with the 
			student's name, student ID, etc. I use this program when tracking 
			my grades since my school didn't have a mid-semester GPA tracker.</p>
